Phoebe: Hi, guys.

嘿，伙计们！
Rachel: Hi! Phoebe.
嘿，菲比。
Monica: Hi Phoebe.
嘿，菲比。
Phoebe: I-I wanted to apologize if I - you know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. You know, it's just the hormones, you know.
我想说声抱歉，我昨天在洗礼会上似乎凶了点，荷尔蒙作祟。
Rachel: No we...
别这样，我们......
Monica: Hormones.
荷尔蒙嘛。
Rachel: ...hormones, yeah.
是啊，荷尔蒙嘛。
Phoebe: Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
谢谢你们，你们真有心。
Monica: Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
你似乎好多了，太好了。你现在怎样？
Phoebe: Good. you know-no-no, but-ok, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
很好，最近的注意力都在我，你们呢？
Rachel: Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
我们正在说我不去参加罗斯的婚礼。
Phoebe: Oh!
哦！
Rachel: It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
有那段过往，我可能很难面对。
Phoebe: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
这让我想起当年流落街头时，有人说我陪他上床就请我吃饭。
Rachel: Well, h-how is this like that?
这两件事哪里像？
Phoebe: Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like you know a bunch of you know high school crap that nobody really gives you know...
我想想，的确不像，因为那才算是问题，你这只是高中女生无病呻吟，没人在乎。
Rachel: I'm-I'm sorry, I guess I just thought that...
抱歉，我只是......
Phoebe: Alright, here come the water works.
泪眼攻势来了。
Joey: Ugh! I don't know what I'm gonna do! I called the company that sent her and th-they don't care!
我已经没辄了！我打给中介站，他们不管我！
Then I called 9-1-1 and they yelld at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
打911又被吼，这还不算紧急事件吗？
Chandler: I'll tell you, Joe. I really wanna help you out but I got plans to go see Titanic so I've gotta call 9-1-1 to find out what time it starts!
我真的很想帮忙，但我打算去看“泰坦尼克号”，所以我要打911问场次！
Ross: Hey guys!
嘿伙计们！
Chandler: Hey!
嘿！
Joey: Hey.
嘿！
Ross: I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
谢谢你，派对办得很棒！
And the guys from work had a blast. You know one of them had never been to a bachelor party before?
博物馆那伙人玩得很爽，其中有一个没参加过单身派对？
Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
另一个没参加过派对，所以......
Joey: So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that is nice!
那个结婚戒指，可真漂亮！
Ross: Yeah, right!
漂亮吧！
Joey: I was uh, I was thinking I might pick one of those babies up for myself, I might wanna get one of those...
我也想买一个，要去哪里买？
Ross: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
那个戒指？我外婆刚来到这个国家时全身上下只有那只戒指 和一小包衣服。
Chandler: So you might say, that the ring is irreplaceable?
所以那只戒指可说是无可取代？
Ross: Oh absolutely! It's been in my family for generations, and every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
当然，它是我家的传家宝，每个戴上它的新娘都能幸福到老。
Chandler: So you might say, it's a magic ring.
所以简直算是一只魔戒。
Joey: Yeah, the stripper stole it.
被脱衣舞娘偷了。
Ross: Huh?
啊？
Joey: What?
什么？
Ross: What-what did you just-
你刚才说？
Chandler: I think I heard what he said. I believe it was, oh yes, "The stripper stole the ring."
我想我听到了，他应该是说“被脱衣舞娘偷了”。
Ross: My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring? ! How-how? ! How could this happen? !
偷了我的戒指？我的戒指？脱衣舞娘偷了我的结婚戒指？怎么会这样？
Chandler: Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
原因就在于你说了“乔伊，你来当我的伴郞吧”。
Ross: All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
好，我来报警！
Joey: Dude, I-I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
我搞砸了你也不用报警捉我吧！
Ross: Not on you! On the stripper!
不是捉你，是捉那个舞娘！
Joey: Oh, yeah, well I-I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
我试过了！他们说等侦破所有谋杀案再说。
Ross: Ok, well, then we-we'll call the company that sent her!
那就找中介！
Joey: I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number.
我也试过了，他们不肯透露她的真名或电话。
They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
他们说我再打去就要报警，我说“你去啊” “就说我掉了一只戒指”。
Ross: So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen? !
难道一点办法也没有？怎么会这样？
Joey: Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
罗斯，我真的很抱歉。
Chandler: Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
我们可以再叫她一次，用假名，把她找去我的办公室？
Joey: Oh, that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find! !
好像不赖，但我们得找戒指！
Monica: Here's your tea Phoebe.
菲比，你的茶。
Phoebe: It's so good. Oh, thanks.
感觉真好，谢谢。
Rachel: Good.
那就好。
Monica: I'm so glad you liked it.
你喜欢就好。
Phoebe: Oh!
哦！
Monica: What? !
什么？
Rachel: What? ! She made the tea!
怎样？茶是她泡的！
Phoebe: Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
不是，我刚才阵痛了。
Rachel: You what?
什么？
Monica: Oh my God!
天哪！
Phoebe: Yeah, I thought I felt one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that definitely was one.
几分钟前就有一次，这次绝对错不了。
Monica: Oh, wait-wait-wait, you-you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
你不能在这里生，男生搬走之后我还没消毒！
Rachel: Ok. It's ok. We're gonna be ok. What-you know what? It's ok. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
没事，别怕，我来烧水撕床单！
Phoebe: No. It's all right; it's probably false labor. They said that that could happen near the end, so just, somebody get the book.
别紧张，可能是假性阵痛，接近预产期会这样，去拿书来。
Monica: Rachel, get the book! The book!
瑞秋，拿书来！书！
Rachel: Ok! Ok! Here!
好！给！
Monica: The Bible? !
圣经？
Rachel: I don't know!
我哪知道啊！
Joey: All right, ok, ok, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
好，很好，钱德，你站到桌子后面。
And-and when she comes in, hopefully, she won't recognize you because, well, why would she?
但愿她一进来不会认得你，因为，她怎么会认得你？
Uh, ok, and then you buzz Ross and I.You be uh, Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
然后你对罗斯和我打暗号，你是冈萨勒斯先生，我是王先生。
Ross: Diverse.
不同种类的民族。
The Stripper: Anybody call for security?
有人叫警卫吗？
Chandler: You be cool.
冷静。
The Stripper: Ok, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
好，哪位是甘瑟中央咖啡馆？乔伊？
Ross: Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
我的戒指呢？我过世的外婆的结婚戒指呢？
Chandler: Way to be cool, man.
你还真冷静。
The Stripper: Hey what's he talking about?
你在说什么？
Joey: There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
床头柜的丝绒盒里有只戒指，你一走它就不见了！
The Stripper: You guys think I stole some ring?
你们觉得我偷了戒指？
The Guys: Yeah!
是的！
Ross: We know you took it so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
一定是你偷的，少废话，从实招来！
The Stripper: Ok, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
你们是哈迪兄弟（摔跤运动员）吗？我不必偷什么戒指 我1星期赚1600，你们有人赚那么多吗？
Chandler: Marry me.
嫁给我。
Joey: I don't get it! It was in my room all night! If she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
我不懂，戒指整晚都在我房里她没拿，我没拿，你没拿，那是谁拿的？安静，我们在想事情！
Rachel: I still don't get how you know when it's false labor.
你怎么会知道是假痛？
Phoebe: Well, do you see any babies?
你有看到宝宝出来吗？
Monica: How do you feel?
你感觉如何？
Phoebe: Ok, I guess. I mean...I don't know, it's just, I guess I just, I know it's gonna be over soon. So-
还好吧，我不知道，大概是知道快要结束了。
Rachel: But, isn't that a good thing? I mean, you said you were sick of this.
那不是很好吗？你说你受够了。
Phoebe: I know. It's just you know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, and-and you know, you know you get to do the mom thing.
我知道，只是通常怀孕完之后，就是当妈妈，
I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.

Phoebe: Ok that's even sadder. Look, I-I know, I know what I got myself into, you know, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them you know, and-and, it's just, it's not gonna be easy when you know, these little babies have to go away.
那样更悲惨，我知道这么做的后果，但他们现在在我肚子里，我仿佛了解他们，把他们送走时我会很难受。
Monica: Aww, I know, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. I mean you're gonna have nieces and nephews, and someways that's even better.

Phoebe: Yeah, ok.
嗯，好吧。
Rachel: No, really. Really, Pheebs, I mean, you-you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, you know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. you know?
不，是真的你不必担心他们的大学学费，或在他们不乖时骂他们，或在他们吵个不停时喂他们吃利他灵。
